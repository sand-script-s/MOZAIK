# MOZAIK - Collage Filmstrips

## About

These works present some my own explorations, using free-association and collage technique, into realms of coincidence/synchronicity, and their potential as tools towards novel invention, insight and therapy.

Most of it was done by haphazardously stringing together a handful of videos based on some or other communal theme, such as a shared object, pattern, or personal association, and then looking for myself to see what new coincidences (such as puns) arise sponaneously from that arrangement.
I was often astounded by unexpected and thought-provoking coincidences and as such I am sharing these in the hopes that others may be inspired thereby, and try their own hand at various such methods. They may perhaps be astounded by what emerges quite unexpectedly from their own collages.
